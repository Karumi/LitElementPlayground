## [0.7.1] - 2019-01-11
### Fixed
* Fix decorator types causing compiler errors for TypeScript users. ([#432](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/432)).

## [0.7.0] - 2019-01-10
### Added
* Updated decorator implementations to support TC39 decorator API proposal (supported by Babel 7.1+) in addition to the legacy decorator API (supported by older Babel and TypeScript) ([#156](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/156)).
* Added `static get styles()` to allow defining element styling separate from `render` method.
This takes advantage of [`adoptedStyleSheets`](https://wicg.github.io/construct-stylesheets/#using-constructed-stylesheets) when possible ([#391](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/391)).
* Added the `performUpdate` method to allow control of update timing ([#290](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/290)).
* Updates deferred until first connection ([#258](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/258)).
* Export `TemplateResult` and `SVGTemplateResult` ([#415](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/415)).
### Changed
* [Breaking] The `createRenderRoot` method has moved from `UpdatingElement` to `LitElement`. Therefore, `UpdatingElement` no longer creates a `shadowRoot` by default ([#391](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/391)).
* [Breaking] Changes property options to add `converter`. This option works the same as the previous `type` option except that the `converter` methods now also get `type` as the second argument. This effectively changes `type` to be a hint for the `converter`. A default `converter` is used if none is provided and it now supports `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, `Object`, and `Array` ([#264](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/264)).
* [Breaking] Numbers and strings now become null if their reflected attribute is removed (https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/264)).
* [Breaking] Previously, when an attribute changed as a result of a reflecting property changing, the property was prevented from mutating again as can happen when a custom
`converter` is used. Now, the oppose is also true. When a property changes as a result of an attribute changing, the attribute is prevented from mutating again (https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/264))
### Fixed
* [Breaking] User defined accessors are now wrapped to enable better composition ([#286](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/286))
* Type for `eventOptions` decorator now properly includes `passive` and `once` options ([#325](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/325))

## [0.6.5] - 2018-12-13
### Changed:
* Use lit-html 1.0 release candidate.

### Fixed
* Types for the `property` and `customElement` decorators updated ([#288](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/288) and [#291](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/291)).
* Docs updated.

## [0.6.4] - 2018-11-30
### Changed
* Update lit-html dependency to ^0.14.0 ([#324](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/324)).

## [0.6.3] - 2018-11-08
### Changed
* Update lit-html dependency to ^0.13.0 ([#298](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/298)).

## [0.6.2] - 2018-10-05

### Changed
* LitElement changed to a non-abstract class to be more compatible with the JavaScript mixin pattern
([#227](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/227)).
* Update lit-html dependency to ^0.12.0 ([#244](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/244)).
* Passes the component's `this` reference to lit-html as the `eventContext`, allowing unbound event listener methods ([#244](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/244)).
### Added
* A `disconnectedCallback()` method was added to UpdatingElement ([#213](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/213)).
* Added `@eventOptions()` decorator for setting event listener options on methods ([#244](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/244)).

## [0.6.1] - 2018-09-17

### Fixed
* Fixes part rendering and css custom properties issues introduced with lit-html 0.11.3 by updating to 0.11.4 (https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/202).

### Removed
* Removed custom_typings for Polymer as they are no longer needed
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/186).

## [0.6.0] - 2018-09-13

### Added
* Added `@query()`, `@queryAll()`, and `@customElement` decorators ([#159](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/159))

### Changed
* Significantly changed update/render lifecycle and property API. Render lifecycle
is now `requestUpdate`, `shouldUpdate`, `update`, `render`, `firstUpdated`
(first time only), `updated`, `updateComplete`. Property options are now
`{attribute, reflect, type, hasChanged}`. Properties may be defined in a
`static get properties` or using the `@property` decorator.
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/132).


### Removed
* Removed render helpers `classString` and `styleString`. Similar directives
(`classMap` and `styleMap`) have been added to lit-html and should be used instead
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/165 and
https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html/pull/486).

### Fixed
* The `npm run checksize` command should now return the correct minified size
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/153).
* The `firstUpdated` method should now always be called the first time the element
updates, even if `shouldUpdate` initially returned `false`
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/173).
